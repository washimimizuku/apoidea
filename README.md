# Apoidea and Genesis

Both of these projects are from 2005, and they have not been updated since. They are here just for history keeping.
## Apoidea

Apoidea was a very rough CMS created by me in 2005. Back in those days, there weren't much MVC frameworks around that were worth it, so this was really helpful. Now it will be here just for history. Maybe someone will find some use for it.

It was later used as a basis for the Genesis project.
## Genesis

Genesis was a Backoffice Generator. It's a python script that reads data schema from an xml, and creates a mySQL and a complete PHP CRUD backoffice. I know, crazy, right?
