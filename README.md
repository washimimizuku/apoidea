# apoidea

Apoidea is a very rough CMS created by me in 2005. Back in those days, there weren't much MVC frameworks around that were worth it, so this was really helpful. Now it will be here just for history. Maybe someone will find some use for it.

It was later used as a basis for the Genesis project.

# genesis

Genesis is a Backoffice Generator. It's a python script that reads data schema from an xml, and creates a mySQL and a complete PHP CRUD backoffice. I know, crazy, right?
